Title: Implementation of the Empirical Bayes Method
Version: 0.1.3
Author: Yiqi Tang, Ryan Martin
Maintainer: Yiqi Tang <ytang22@ncsu.edu>
Description: Implements a Bayesian-like approach to the high-dimensional sparse linear regression problem based on an empirical or data-dependent prior distribution, which can be used for estimation/inference on the model parameters, variable selection, and prediction of a future response. The method was first presented in Martin, Ryan and Mess, Raymond and Walker, Stephen G (2017) <doi:10.3150/15-BEJ797>. More details focused on the prediction problem are given in Martin, Ryan and Tang, Yiqi (2019) <arXiv:1903.00961>.
